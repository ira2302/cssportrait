        You're the one that never lets me sleep
        To my mind, down to my soul, you touch my lips
        You're the one that I can't wait to see
        With you here by my side, I'm in ecstasy
        I am all alone without you
        My days are dark without a glimpse of you
        Now that you came into my life, I feel complete
        The flowers bloom, my morning shines, and I can see
        Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
        I feel the warmth inside
        Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins
        I feel the chill inside
        Every time I hear our music play
        Reminds me of the things we've been through
        In my mind, I can't believe it's true
        But in my heart, the reality is you
        I am all alone without you
        My days are dark without a glimpse of you
        But now that you came into my life, I feel complete
        The flowers bloom, my morning shines, and I can see
        Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
        I feel the warmth inside
        Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins
        I feel the chill inside
        Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
        I feel the warmth inside
        Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins
        I feel the chill inside
        Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
        I feel the warmth inside
        Your love is like the river that flows down through my veins
        I feel the chill inside
        Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
        I feel the warmth inside
        Your love is like the river, flows down through my veins
        I feel the chill inside
        Your love, your love
        Won't you give me your love tonight?
        Your love

        Sandali na lang, maaari bang pagbigyan?
Aalis na nga, maaari bang hawakan ang iyong mga kamay?
Sana ay maabot ng langit ang 'yong mga ngiti
Sana ay masilip

[Refrain]
'Wag kang mag-alala, 'di ko ipipilit sa'yo
Kahit na lilipad ang isip ko'y torete sa'yo

[Verse 2]
Ilang gabi pa nga lang nang tayo'y pinagtagpo
Na parang may tumulak nanlalamig, nanginginig na ako
Akala ko nung una may bukas ang ganito
Mabuti pang umiwas, pero salamat na rin at nagtagpo

[Chorus]
Torete, torete, torete ako
Torete, torete, torete sa'yo

[Refrain]
'Wag kang mag-alala, 'di ko ipipilit sa'yo
Kahit na lilipad ang isip ko'y torete sa'yo

[Chorus]
Torete, torete, torete ako
Torete, torete, torete ako

Can I call you baby?
Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, I don't pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is givin' in, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst
If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
I can fill those places in your heart no else can
Let me show you love, oh, I don't pretend, yeah
I'll be right here, baby, you know I'll sink or swim
Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth, yeah
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first (put you first)
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst

Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts, sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line, it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
Circus life under the big-top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wonderin' where I am lost without you
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Forever yours
Faithfully

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, hmm
Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the Light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Woah, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea, yeah
Lonely rivers sigh
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Woah, my love, my darling
I've hungered, hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

The more I tell you you can do this
The more you tell yourself you're useless
Any advice right now is fruitless
You're somewhere only you can go
I won't pretend to know, so
Instead of telling you you'll be alright
I'm just gon' be that someone by your side
Yeah let me be that distant satellite
A constant in the sky
'Cause I'm standing with you tonight
Yeah I will be that voice in your ear
Quietly destroying your fear
You won't even know that I'm here
But I'm standing with you tonight
Oh I will be the pill for your pain
Until the clouds have run out of rain
Close enough but just out of sight
I'm standing with you tonight
Your head is full and yet it's hollow
Don't even think about tomorrow
So if you let me I will follow
Oh if you're gonna go
At least you're gonna know
Instead of telling you you'll be alright
I'm just gon' be that someone by your side
Oh let me be that distant satellite
A constant in the sky
I'm standing with you tonight
Yeah I will be that voice in your ear
Quietly destroying your fear
You won't even know that I'm here
But I'm standing with you tonight
Oh I will be the pill for your pain
Until the clouds have run out of rain
Close enough but just out of sight
I'm standing with you
I know I may not say the right thing
Let me tell you one thing
Yeah 'cause there is one thing
You're wrong about
This world would not be a better place
I don't wanna lose you now
Yeah I will be that voice in your ear
Quietly destroying your fear
Oh you won't even know that I'm here
I'm standing with you tonight
Oh I will be the pill for your pain
Until the clouds have run out of rain
Close enough but just out of sight
I'm standing with you tonight
Oh tonight
I'm standing with you tonight
I'm standing with you tonight  You're the one that never lets me sleep

Close enough but just out of sight
I'm standing with you
I know I may not say the right thing
Let me tell you one thing
Yeah 'cause there is one thing
You're wrong about
This world would not be a better place
I don't wanna lose you now
Yeah I will be that voice in your ear
Quietly destroying your fear
Oh you won't even know that I'm here
I'm standing with you tonight
Oh I will be the pill for your pain
Until the clouds have run out of rain
Close enough but just out of sight
I'm standing with you tonight
Oh tonight
I'm standing with you tonight
I'm standing with you tonight
